# 463Project1
Design a system that performs unsupervised clustering of time-series segments extracted from PulseDB, using divide-and-conquer strategies and algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to group similar physiological signal segments (e.g., ECG, PPG, ABP) and analyze their internal structure using closest pair algorithms and maximum subarray analysis.
